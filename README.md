# 🏊 42 Piscine Projects

This repository contains my journey through the **42 Piscine**, a month-long intensive program where I learned the basics of C programming, algorithms, and Unix systems. Each folder represents a set of exercises, exams, or rush projects completed during the Piscine.

## 📚 Contents

### 🧠 Core Projects

These directories (C00 to C09) contain standard exercises focused on core C concepts:

```
C00/       # Basic I/O, ft_putchar, ft_putstr, ft_strlen
C01/       # Pointers, arrays, memory manipulation
C02/       # Functions, conditionals, recursion
C03/       # String manipulation functions
C04/       # Standard library reimplementation
C05/       # Advanced recursion and power functions
C06/       # String splitting and tab manipulation
C07/       # Sorting and advanced algorithms
C08/       # File descriptors, file operations
C09/       # Structured exercises, e.g. ex02: project integration
```

### 🎓 Rush Projects

Rushes are weekend group projects meant to simulate real-world collaboration and pressure:

```
rush00/ex00/   # First rush project
rush01/ex00/   # Second rush challenge
rush02/ex00/   # Final rush with higher difficulty
```

### 📚 Shell & Logic

Foundational exercises to get comfortable with Unix and Shell scripting:

```
shell00/   # Basic shell usage and file manipulation
shell01/   # Scripting and permission management
```

### 🔍 Practice & Exams

```
exam_exercises/   # Preparatory exercises for piscine exams
BSQ/bsq/          # BSQ algorithm implementation (rush-style)
accept_lisboa/1st_step/   # Pre-piscine setup and first contact with 42
```
